Revision history for Perl extension Quantum::Entanglement.

0.20 - Fri Jan 19 2001 13:00:00

           + root_not demo and explaination
           + :complex so that you don't need to say use Math::Complex as well
           ~ removed all the compile time eval fun
           - can no longer seed states with annon arrays, must use M::C

0.11 - Tue Jan 16 2001 20:00:00

Changes    + compilation evals sanity checked, those in run time left
             alone.
           + general internal clean up

BUGFIXES   '~' is not a binary operator !!!

0.10 - Tue Jan 16 2001 00:30:00

Changes    + Documentation padded out with general info and more examples
           + shor.pl prints out more information

0.04 - Mon Jan 15 2001 01:00:00

Changes    + ability to change way in which collapsed states are treated
             by setting $Quantum::Entanglement::destroy
           + first version of shor.pl, for factoring numbers

BUGFIXES   Various reasons why the module didn't compile on some systems
           Makefile.PL horribly b0rked

0.03 - Sun Jan 14 2001 01:00:00

Changes    + q_logic can act on more than one variable at a time
           + Documentation now up to date
           + probability now stored internally as Math::Complex numbers
           + entangle can be called with Math::Complex numbers
           ~ show_states not exported

BUGFIXES:  bool not returning false if all states false

0.02 - Sat Jan 13 2001 03:00:00

Changes:   + Internal structure made better, probability now sticks to
           states in a more sensible way.
           + q_logic function, so that I could write a root-not logic gate.

BUGFIXES:  probability now works
